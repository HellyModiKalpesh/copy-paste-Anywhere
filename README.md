This is a Python Flask application that implements an authentication system and file upload/download functionality. 
The authentication system uses JWT tokens to authenticate users, and the file upload/download functionality allows users to upload and download files with a token-based system.
The signup endpoint is used to register a new user with a username, password, and email ID.
The login endpoint is used to generate a JWT token for a registered user based on their email ID and password. 
The upload endpoint is used to upload a file with a given token, and the download endpoint is used to download a file with a given token.
The send_email function is used to send an email with the token to the user when a file is uploaded. The logout endpoint is used to log out a user and invalidate their JWT token.
This code uses SQLAlchemy to create a MySQL database to store user and file data. The Flask application uses the Flask-JWT-Extended extension to handle JWT authentication.
The Flask-CORS extension is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API. The os and string modules are used to manipulate file paths and generate random tokens.
The smtplib and ssl modules are used to send email notifications when a file is uploaded.
